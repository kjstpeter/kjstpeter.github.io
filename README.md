# About me
## Interests
Some of my biggest interests, that do not include my friends and family, are reading and astrology. I know astrology is an oddball interest. 
I actually started learning about astrology during COVID. It was the only hobby from that crazy time that I still participate in. I like finding the
correlated patterns between the stars and real life. As for reading it has been a life long passion, particularly the fantasy genre. I like 
seeing how authors write magic systems and how said system influences the characters' actions. Not that I do not read other genres, but I will say 
out of the 200+ (almost 300) physical books I owe a vast majority of them are fantasy.

## Website I Reccomend
Websites I would reccomend based off my hobbies if one finds it peaks anyone's interest. 
[AstroSeek](https://www.astro-seek.com) is the site I use for getting the different types of birth charts.
[THe Dark Pixie](https://www.thedarkpixieastrology.com) and [Advanced Astrology](https://advanced-astrology.com) are some of my most used cites when 
resarching a specific aspects or placement. Though I will say sometimes I feel like their interpretations hit a little too close to home. Both of these 
sites are very informative and make the content easily digestible in my opinion.

Now my book websites have to be [Story Graph](https://thestorygraph.com) and [Libib](https://www.libib.com).
Story Graph is a site that I use to track my reading progress and my TBR. I don't use it as frequently as I should for how much I read but I enjoy
the site when I do remember to use it. Libib is a site I use so I can remember which books I have in my vast collection. It is easy to use and can 
link to my phone for an easier time to scan all my newly acquired books into the system.
